# Text Emotion Classification

This repository contains an ongoing project for text emotion classification using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop models capable of accurately predicting the emotional content of textual data.

## Project Overview

Text emotion classification is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP) with various real-world applications, including sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring. This project aims to explore different machine learning approaches to classify emotions in textual data.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `dataset/`: Contains raw data files.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and utility functions.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for various components of the project.
- `app/`: Placeholder directory for potential deployment scripts or files.
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now!
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing:** Explore and preprocess the raw textual data using the scripts in `src/data_preprocessing.py`.
- **Model Training:** Train different models using the scripts in `src/model_training.py`.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using the scripts in `src/evaluation.py`.
- **Experimentation:** Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for exploratory data analysis and experimentation with different approaches.
